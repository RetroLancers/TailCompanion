# Hytale Content Cadence Planning

This skill guides the strategic planning of content updates to maintain player interest and maximize asset reuse in Hytale mods.

## When to use this skill

- Planning a roadmap for a mod or server.
- Designing "Seasonal" updates or "Themed" packs.
- Balancing major feature releases with minor cosmetic drops.

## Strategy

### 1. The Pyramid of Content
- **Base (High Frequency)**: Simple recolors, minor cosmetics (hats, collars). Weekly drops.
- **Middle (Medium Frequency)**: New entity variants, minor AI updates, quest additions. Monthly drops.
- **Top (Low Frequency)**: Entirely new systems (e.g., world-gen, complex mini-games). Quarterly drops.

### 2. Asset Reuse
Maximize the value of every 3D model.
- A "Wolf" model can be reused for a "Coyote", "Husky", and "Spirit Wolf" by just swapping textures and adding minor particle effects.

### 3. Theme-Based Releases
Group content logically to create hype.
- "Winter Solstice Pack": Blue/White recolors, ice-themed pets, and festive hats.

## Best Practices

- **Predictability**: Consistent update schedules build a loyal player base.
- **Automation**: Use the `blender-python-generation` skill to generate the bulk of your "Base" tier content automatically.
- **Example (Pet)**: A "Summer Splash" update is planned featuring 5 existing pets with "Swimwear" cosmetics and a new "Beach Ball" toy. This provides high player value with minimal new engineering effort.
